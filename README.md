# Video-Game-Pandas-Analysis
In this analysis, I took raw data on a video game called "Heroes of Pymoli" and attempted to find meaningful insights into the game's purchasing data.
Heroes of Pymoli is a fantasy game from an independent gaming company that encourages players to purchase optional items to enhance their playing experience. 
First, I attempted to manipulate my data to get more insight into whether gender played a factor in who was playing and purchasing items in the game. 
The data shows that the percentage of players playing this game and making purchases are predominately males. 84% of players were male to be exact. 

Next, I attempted to determine if the game and it's purchases could be narrowed down to certain age brackets. I found that almost half(44.79%) of players 
generating purchase in the game fell into the 20-24 age bracket. If you extrapolate this out a bit further, almost 77% of gamers making purchases fall
betweem ages 15 and 29. This shows that games are more likely to play this game as teens and young adults.

Finally, I attempted to analyze what in-game items were being purchased the most and generating the most profits for the company. In this case, the most 
popular item purchased, "Final Critic" was also the most profitable item. This seems to suggest this item is important for gamer's success during gameplay, 
and also that obtaining this item brings enjoyment to the user's experience.
